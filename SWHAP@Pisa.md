Introduction
============

The presentation process, abstract view {#sec:processabs}
==========================

#### Present in SWH-stories

This way of presenting the recovered source code is inspired by the [[https://sciencestories.io]{.underline}](https://sciencestories.io) website.

TDB : decide between an *embedded* or an *external* approach. In the embedded case we insert here a  description as abstract as possible of the process to create a SWH-story, and see how to put other information in the rest of the document. In the external case, we refer to a new document, based on Morane and Kat's report, completed with a section related to the support in the adjourned template of SWHAPPE.
