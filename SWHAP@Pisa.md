Introduction
============
**Create a SWH-story**

The suggested process to document the recovered source code with a story in the SWH-stories website [[https://swh.stories.k2.services/stories/]{.underline}](https://swh.stories.k2.services/stories/) has two phases:
- Collect, where the Presentation designer collects the images, videos, documents to be published. For each item, he also gathers in a suitably structered *inventory* in the Workbench the information nedeed to insure that once uploaded in the appropriate Wikimedia data base the item is satisfactorily self documenting. The Presentation designer should also take care that the item can be granted a pubblic domain license, as required by Wikimedia policies.
- Publish, where the Web engineer, in this case the Wikimedia expert, uploads the items in such a way that they are best presented exploiting the STORIES SERVICE at [[http://stage.stories.k2.services/publisher/]{.underline}].

The story will be available at [(https://swh.stories.k2.services/stories/){.underline}]. Since the story is dinamically constructed at each access, the above process can be freely iterated, to add new elements or to correct the presented information.

TBD : Choose between inserting the sentence *The process is described in detail in ???* or elaborate here the description above.
The presentation process, abstract view {#sec:processabs}

TBD : Presentation designer might be abstract, and instantiated as SWH-stories designer in this version.
==========================

#### Present in SWH-stories

This way of presenting the recovered source code is inspired by the [[https://sciencestories.io]{.underline}](https://sciencestories.io) website.

TDB : decide between an *embedded* or an *external* approach. In the embedded case we insert here a  description as abstract as possible of the process to create a SWH-story, and see how to put other information in the rest of the document. In the external case, we refer to a new document, based on Morane and Kat's report, completed with a section related to the support in the adjourned template of SWHAPPE.

Roles in the process
--------------------

* Curator

Presentation designer and Web engineer

Though most of the presentations of the archived software will be on line, the abilities to design the contents of a presentation should be considered separately from the technical ones. For instance, in the case of the SWH-stories, the presentation designer should be competent in the topic addressed by the code, to be able to search and select the items to be inserted in the story. On the other side, the web engineer should be acknowledgeable of Wikimedia and the other tools involved in creating the stories.
