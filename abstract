The presentation of acquired source code of landmark legacy software is particularly important.

This document presents the first version of the integration of WikiMedia and ScinceStories.io 
presentation into SWHAP, the Software Heritage Acquisition Process: a protocol for the collection and preservation of software
of historical and scientific relevance. SWHAP results from a fruitful
collaboration of the University of Pisa with Software Heritage in this area of
research, under the auspices of UNESCO, and has been validated on a selection of
software source code produced in the Pisa area over the past 50 years.
