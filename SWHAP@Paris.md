Introduction
============

Software is everywhere, binding our personal and social lives, embodying
a vast part of the technological knowledge that powers our industry,
supports modern research, mediates access to digital content and fuels
innovation. In a word, a rapidly increasing part of our collective
knowledge is embodied in, or depends on software artifacts.

Software does not come out of the blue: it is written by humans, in the
form of software Source Code, a precious, unique form of knowledge that,
besides being readily translated into machine-executable form, should
also "be written for humans to read" (@Abelson:SIC85), and "provides a
view into the mind of the designer" (@Shustek06).

As stated in the Paris Call on Software Source code as Heritage for
sustainable development (@ParisCall2019), from the
UNESCO-Inria expert group meeting, it is essential to preserve this
precious technical, scientific and cultural heritage over the long term.

Software Heritage is a non-profit, multi-stakeholder initiative,
launched by Inria in partnership with UNESCO, that has taken over this
challenge. Its stated mission is to collect, preserve, and make readily
accessible all the software source code ever written, in the Software
Heritage Archive. To this end, Software Heritage designed specific
strategies to collect software according to its nature (@swhcacm2018).

For software that is easily accessible online, and that can be copied
without specific legal authorizations, the approach is based on
automation. This way, as of September 2019, Software Heritage has
already archived more than 6 billion unique source code files from over
90 million different origins, focusing in priority on popular software
development platforms like GitHub and GitLab and rescuing software
source code from legacy platforms, such as Google Code and Gitorious
that once hosted more than 1.5 million projects.

For source code that is not easily accessible online, a different
approach is needed. It is necessary to cope with the variety of physical
media where the source code may be stored, the multiple copies and
versions that may be available, the potential input of the authors that
are still alive, and the existence of ancillary materials like
documentation, articles, books, technical reports, email exchanges. Such
an approach shall be based on a focused search, involving a significant
amount of human intervention, as demonstrated by the pioneering works
reconstructing the history of Unix (@SpinellisUnix2017) and the source code
of the Apollo Guidance Computer (@VirtualAGC).

This document presents the first version of SWHAP, the ***SoftWare
Heritage Acquisition Process*** to rescue, curate and illustrate
landmark legacy software source code, a joint initiative of Software
Heritage and the University of Pisa, in collaboration with UNESCO. 

The SWHAP process aims at preserving and presenting legacy software and related materials in a **digital** format, to ensure long term availability of the curated materials and the possibility to share and present it to a broad audience. 

<a name="context"/>

Who is this guide for and what do you need to get started?
============

The goal of this guide is to allow any party interested in preserving, curating and presenting legacy softwares in a digital format to achieve the SWHAP process in full autonomy. 
Typically :
- An archive, museum or library 
- A company or research center
- Any individual wishing to archive its own legacy software products

Copyright disclaimer
--------------------

The individual or institution entering the SWHAP process should have all copyrights on the collected documents
TO DO: ellaborate on this

What entities are involved?
--------------------

- *A physical archive*: a physical location where physical raw materials are safely archived and stored. Maintaining the physical archive is the responsibility of the owner of the physical products or any third party untrusted by the owner, like a physical archive or a museum. 
- *Digital archives*: in the SWHAP process various types of digital archives are used for different types or artefacts. The proposed process relies on open source solutions even though you may be free to chose alternative options. The responsibility of maintaining these open-source digital archives lies in the different entities or consortia implementing them. The use of open source solutions ensure the best perenity of the archiving over time. 
- *Online presentation plateform*: although you are free to recreate your own website to present your software collection, we offer in this guide to leverage an open-source solution called "Science stories". In this guide we will show you how to contribute to the [Software Heritage implementation](https://stories.softwareheritage.org/), eventhough you may decide to create your own dedicated instance.
- *Digital working environment*: between the collection of physical or digital artefacts and the final archiving and presentation of the software a series of operations will have to be performed in a digital environment, which we will refer to as working depositories. If your are implementing the SWHAP process you will be responsible for implementing and managing these depositories, and to transfer part of its content to the digital archives and to the presentation plateform of your choice. We will further elaborate about that later in this document.

What are the different roles invovled?
--------------------

MF:  The role do not match the roles proposed in the workbecnh template (author, collector, curator). I would be in favor of making it simpler. If the process is simple enough (we should aim for it) there should bot be a need for archive engineer or web engineer.

With respect to the human resources, several roles are needed to enact
the process, as indicated in the top part of fig. 1. Here is a short
summary of the involved capabilities.

- **Collector**: Searches and receives the raw materials. Identifies, classifies and
separates source code and ancillary materials.
- **Deposit engineer**: Masters the procedures to archive physical and digital materials, in the
local context.
- **Curator**: Prepares the version history, identifying the authors and other
contributors. Provides a context to the source code, choosing among the
ancillary materials.
- **Archive engineer**: Masters the procedures to transfer the curated source code to SWH and to
publish the context in the Wikies.
- **Presentation designer and Web engineer**: These are out of the scope of this document, and are mentioned only to
note that, though most of the presentations of the archived software
will be on line, the abilities to design the contents of a presentation
should be considered separately from the technical ones.

**[Remark]{.underline}** the roles indicated above need not necessarily
be played by different persons, e.g., Collector and Curator may be the
same person, nor be played by a unique person, e.g., there can be
several cooperating Curators, in case of large systems.

What if I am stuck or have a question ?
--------------------

Because we are still developping and improving the SWHAP process you may stumble upon some difficulties, have some doubts on the best practices to adopt or you may just want to suggest an improvment. 

First, we suggest you checkout our FAQ: TO DO: create FAQ and input link

Section {@sec:processabs} provides an *abstract* view of SWHAP, its steps,
documents and resources. No specific assumptions on the *tools, platforms and
technologies* that may be used to enact it are made, but some requirements are
made explicit. Section {@sec:processconcrete} describes how the abstract process
is implemented at the University of Pisa by leveraging the Git toolset and the
GitHub collaborative development platform. This implementation is named SWHAPPE
(SWH Acquisition Process Pisa Enactor) in this document. Finally, Section {@sec:walkthrough}
provides a walkthrough on an annotated example, using a real world medium-sized software
project (@AttardiF96).

<a name="abstractview"/>

The process, abstract view {#sec:processabs}
==========================

This section describes SWHAP, the acquisition process for software
artifacts at an *abstract* level, that is, without making specific
assumptions on the *tools, platforms and technologies* that may be used
to perform the various operations described here.

![Source code acquisition process.](./media/image1.png){#fig:absprocess}

The activities involved in the acquisition process can be organized in the
following four phases.

- **Collect**: the first phase  is *conservative*, i.e., it is devoted to save the raw materials, in their physical or digital format, that the other phases will build upon.
- **Curate**: the second phase aims at *analyzing, cleaning up and structuring* the raw materials that have been collected.
- **Archive**: the third phase's goal is to contribute the curated materials to the digital infrastructures specialized for each kind of materials. From this stage on, all the curated material should have been digitalised in order to be processed. 
- **Present** The purpose of this phase is to create dedicated presentations of the curated materials.

Figure {@fig:absprocess} provides a pictorial view of the process, its phases,
data stores and roles.

Collect
------ 

The purpose of this phase is *to find* the source code and related
materials and *gather* it *as is* in a physical and/or logical place
where it can be properly *archived* for later processing. 

Various *strategies* are possible for collecting the raw materials: a
dedicated team may proactively search for the artifact of specific
software that has been identified as relevant (*pull approach*), or a
crowdsourcing process may be set up to allow interested parties to
submit software that has not been previously identified (*push
approach*).

*Source code* can be provided in a *digital* or *physical* form.
Typically, source code for old machines (such as the first Italian
computer, CEP, now exposed in the Pisa museum of computing) is available
only as paper printouts that may even include hand-written comments: all
these materials deserve to be preserved.

*Related materials* can include research articles, pictures, drawings,
user manuals: all of these are part of the software history and need to
be preserved as well as the source code.

At this stage of elaboration of the process, this phase is better
thought of as *abstract*, in the sense that several, more focussed
descriptions should be provided to cater for the different situations
identified. The same applies to the Curator role, which may need
different capabilities in different scenarios.

Curate
------ 

The purpose of this phase is *to* *analyze, cleanup and structure* the
raw materials that have been collected.

Preparing software source code for archival in **Software Heritage**
requires special care: the source code needs to be *cleaned up*,
different *versions* with their *production dates need to be
ascertained*, and the *contributors need to be identified* in order to
build a *faithful history of the evolution* of the software over time.

For both source code artifacts and ancilliary artificats, proper *metadata* should be created and made available, providing all the key information about the artifacts that are discovered during the curation phase. 

<!--
Regarding source code artifcats, we recommend to use the
vocabulary provided by **CodeMeta** as an extension to schema.org (see
[[https://codemeta.github.io/terms/]{.underline}](https://codemeta.github.io/terms/));
this includes the software runtime platform, programming languages,
authors, license, etc.
For other artifacts we will provide a dedicated template. 
-->


Particular care is required to *identify the owners* of the different
artifacts, and *obtain if needed the necessary authorizations* to make
these artifacts publicly available[^1].

Archive
------ 

The purpose of this phase is to contribute the curated materials to the
infrastructures specialized for each kind of materials: ***Software
Heritage*** for the *source code*, ***Wikimedia*** for *images or
videos*, ***open access repositories*** for *research articles*,
***Wikidata*** for *software descriptions and properties*, and so on.

As much as possible we will promote using free and open-source platforms for archiving your content. 
However this may come with some restrictions : 
- some plateforms have size limits (which may be an issue for uploading large files like videos)
- uploading documents to Wikimedia requires a free license, which might not be the case for all the collected materials

In these cases the use of private infrastructures can be considered (like Youtube for large videos). 
Institutionnal media libraries can also be an option for materials with restricted copy rights. 

Well established guidelines are available for contributing materials to
Wikimedia (see
[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:First\_steps/Contributing]{.underline}](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:First_steps/Contributing))
and Wikidata (see
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Data\_donation]{.underline}](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Data_donation)
), hence we will focus more specically on curating and contributing the
software source code to Software Heritage, a process that is new and may
require rather technical steps.

Present
------  

The purpose of this phase is to create dedicated presentations of the
curated materials.

Once the curated materials are made available in the dedicated
infrastructures, it is possible to use it to create presentations for a
variety of purposes: special events, virtual or physical expositions for
museums or websites.

In this guide we will show you how to display you work in a specific format, called [_**Software Story**_](https://stories.softwareheritage.org/).
The _Software Story_ pulls from different public sources (Wikimedia, Wikidata, Software Heritage, Youtube...) to automatically create a presentation of you software. 
This is only a proposition, feel free to use any other tool or platform you may like. 


<!--
For this, the archived materials need to be referenced using the
identifiers that each platform provides for its contents. Software
Heritage provides intrinsic persistent identifiers that are fully
documented at
[[https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-model/persistent-identifiers.html]{.underline}](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-model/persistent-identifiers.html)

The presentation phase is out of the scope of this document, and as such
we are currently not providing a supporting implementation. Anyway, a
good example of what can be done is the
[[https://sciencestories.io]{.underline}](https://sciencestories.io)
website.
-->

An iterative process
--------------------

New information may arise at any time: new raw materials may be
discovered, refined information may be identified that needs to be added
to the curation, and mistakes may need to be corrected. Hence, the
overall process must be seen as *iterative*, in the sense that, when new
data are available, the pertinent phase can be re-entered and the
process enacted once more from there to update all the relevant
information. This suggests that, whenever possible, the data stores
should be fully versionable, not to loose historical information about
the acquisition process itself.

<!--Resources needed by the process
-------------------------------

As any process supported digitally, SWHAP needs both human and technical
resources to be enacted.

First of all, several data stores and working areas are needed, to save
and make public the intermediate products, which are themselves of
value, as already mentioned, and to pass the collected information
across the phases. These are shown in the lower part of Figure 1, and
are summarized here. -->

<!--

MF: I think this should be moved earlier in the document and explaining who is responible for what. I don't fully get the role of the Despository. I don't think things are "safely archived" on Github (otherwise we wouldn't need SWH!), so I don't see the point of maintaining the depository there. 
Also this is mixing thing which are part of the SWHAP process iteself and some which are not (like the warehouse). 

### Warehouse

A physical location where physical raw materials are safely archived and
stored, with the usual acquisition process[^2].

### Depository

A virtual space where digital raw materials are safely archived. The raw
digital materials found in the Depository are used in the Curation phase
to produce the source code that Software Heritage can ingest in the
Archive phase.

The Depository holds also the related raw materials that may be
elaborated and deposited in locations like WikiData, WikiMedia etc. -
referred to as **Wikies** in fig. 1 - in the other phases.

### Workbench

Any implementation of the process will need a virtual space and working
environment where the activities can be carried out, with support for
temporary storage and for logging the various operations in a journal.

### Curated source code deposit

A fully versioned repository, holding the reconstructed development
history of the source code, in view of its transfer to Software
Heritage.

### Catalogues and journals

As shown in fig. 1, according to the best practices of the archival
sciences, each phase shall produce both a *Catalogue* of its products
and a *Journal* recording its activities - *who did what, and when*. A
list of the *Actors* involved in the process is also necessary.
Provision to store all these information safely has to be foreseen in
any supporting implementation.
-->



<!--
**[Remark]{.underline}** the technical resources described above in
abstract terms, may be implemented in a variety of ways. For example,
one can imagine a single Depository for all the software projects that
are collected, but it is also possible to use a separate Depository for
each software project, and the same holds for all the other areas.
-->



Implementation requirements
---------------------------

The abstract process may be implemented using different tools, platforms
and technologies, as long as the following key requirements are
satisfied.

- **Long term availability**: The places where the artefact (both raw and curated) are stored must
provide sufficient guarantees of availability over the long term. These
places may be physical (warehouses), or logical (depositories).
- **Historical accuracy**: Any supporting implementation should support the faithful recording of
the authorship of the source code as well as of the reconstruction
process, e.g., via a flexible versioning system.
- **Traceability**: It must be possible to trace the origin of each of the artifacts that
are collected, curated and deposited. For physical materials, we refer
to common practice[^3]. For digital artifacts, it is recommended to keep
a *journal of all the operations* that are performed, and to automate
them as much as possible, as the collection and curation process may
require several iterations.
- **Openness**: Any supporting implementation should be based on open and free tools and
standards.
- **Interoperability**: Any supporting implementation should provide support for the cooperation
and coordination of the many actors playing the many roles of the
acquisition process.

<a name="concreteview"/>

The process, a concrete view {#sec:processconcrete}
============================

MF: the process should start with collecting, are at least making it clear we are not tackling it here. Otherwise hard to understand where we are starting from. 

In this process we are assuming that you have a place (refered to as _Warehouse_) to gather any relevant physical artifacts. Because the SWHAP process is about digital archiving and presenting, we also assume that you have digitalized (scanning or taking pictures) of these items to be further ingested in the SWHAP process. From now own, we will be focusing on the digital process only. 

Seeting up your digital working environment
----------------

### General structure

In order to implement SWHAP, the first step is to create the *Digital working environment* that will allow you to store the collected digital artifacts and to curate them. This can very well be set up using
distinct digital platforms, but it is also possible to instantiate all
of them on a single platform.

The latter choice was made for the SWHAP Pisa Enactor (SWHAPPE). The
implementation adopted by the SWHAP\@Pisa project relies on the
collaborative platform [[GitHub]{.underline}](https://github.com/) (
[[https://github.com/]{.underline}](https://github.com/) ) as a host
platform for all the virtual support areas of the process. If you are interested in further understaning the rational for using Github, you can refere to Appendix A. TO DO: add link

The core of the process will take place in your *Digital working environnement*. We propose to structure your *Digital working environment* into three disctinct areas, materialized by different folders, also called repositories on Github.

> *Workbench* repository, a working
> area where one can temporarily collect an curate the materials, only accessible to people directly working on the project;
>
> *Depository* repository, will be used as the final and publicly available depository, allowing anyone interested to visit your work, check the curation process and browse through collected materials. The Depository can also be used as default archiving location if no better option was found; 
>
> *Source Code* repository, will be used to store the "synthetic" version of the source code, as rebuilt by the curation team for old projects that did not use a version control system. This repository will be the source of ingestion for Software Heritage archiving process.


Note that *Workbench* repository will be instantiated at the very beginning of the process as your main working environnement. *Depository* repository and *Source Code* repository will be instantiated later on, as specific extracts from the *Workbench*. Let's first see how to instantiate your *Workbench*.

### Instantiating your Workbench

<!--
MF: is this comment needed ? Maybe to precise at this stage (avoiding mental overload). 
Let's remark that SWHAPPE has *different* Workbench and Depository
repositories for each code acquisition, but it would also be possible to
use a single Workbench repository and/or a single Depository repository
to work on all the collected software, provided one maintains a
well-organised directory structure which keeps the codes separated. On
the other hand, we *need* a Source Code repository for each software
project, to be actually ingested in the Software Heritage archive.
-->

<!--
The Warehouse is quite similar to the usual storage area where museums
preserve their collections; it will need to be set up in a specific
physical location, following the well established process for museums,
so we will not cover it in this guide.
-->

We created a *template* repository that you can easily copy to instantiate your dedicated workbench. 
The [SWHAP-TEMPLATE](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAP-TEMPLATE) embodies the core support to enact the process. Its
structure and use is shown in figure 2. After copying it, you can change its name to *SWName-Workbench* ; the *SWName* being the name of the Software you are working on. 

We recommand you to clone your *SWName-Workbench*
repository to your machine, so that
you can work on the collected files locally - the Git clone mechanism
ensures that these changes can be safely moved to the original
repository, for publication and sharing with other actors in the
acquisition.

<!-- Too detailed at this point IMO
We create two dedicated *branches*[^4], that allow to track separately
the operations that will be later moved to the Depository and the
Development History Deposit: *Depository*, to contain the raw materials
and the browsable sources as well as the metadata, and *SourceCode* to
organize the source code in view of the reconstruction of its
development history. Finally, the *Depository* and *SourceCode* branches will
become two distinct repositories: the latter is shipped to the Software Heritage
archive, the former is published by the organization promoting the
acquisition.
-->

![Overview of the SWHAPPE approach](./media/image2.png){#fig:swhappe}

Figure 2. Overview of the SWHAPPE process.

### Workbench structure

The structure of the template is shown in Fig. 3.
MF: TO DO update this graph and the screenshot, to make it simpler

<!-- 

MF: I don't understand this sentence,le t's just discribe each folder and what is it for

First of all, we can see a correspondence between the Depository
presented in the process and the area provided by `raw_materials` and
`browsable_source`: indeed, these two folders will be moved in order to
instantiate the Depository, once they have been loaded, the former with
the original materials, just as they have been found or submitted, the
latter with a first revision of the source code, made accessible through
the GitHub web interface, e.g., archives should be decompressed, code
transcribed from pictures, etc.
-->

Your newly created workbench is composed of the following folders:
- The `raw_source_code` folder used to store the collected source code in their intial format (ex: source code can be a scanned document) 
- The `browsable_source_code` folder is used to store source code in browsable format (ex: if needed the source as been transcribed in machine readable format)
- The `versionned_source_code` folder will be used to recreate the development history of the software, using the *commit* and *versioning* mechanisms of
- The `additional_materials` folder is used to store all the other collected materials (video, pictures, documents etc)
- The `software_stories` folder is used prepare material for creation of the _Software Story_
*Git*
- The `metadata folder`, is used to record all the information about the
software and the acquisition process (catalogue, actors, journal, etc.).

MF: Should we create a metafolder for the code items?
MF: I think we need to keep separate the `additional_materials` for non code items (collect and curate), and a dedicated `software story` folder for _presenting_ both code + additional material
MF: I think the actors.md file is confusing. Is it a project metadata file, recording curators ? Or is a data file, recording historical information about who contributed to the software. I think these should be two separate things.

<!--
The guidelines to fill this part are given in the template itself. (MF: I think we should include part of it in the guide, otherwise not clear when is the best moment to fill them in)
-->
<!--
The `source` folder is provided as the starting point for the creation of
the Source Code *Git* repository, in the curation phase. The curator has
to recognize each major version of the code, and refactor it accordingly
- one separate folder per each version. To create the Source Code
Deposit, however, we exploit the *commit* and *versioning* mechanisms of
*Git*.
-->

As part of the instantiation, you can fill in the first metadata of your project. Go to the `metadata` folder, open the `actors.md` file and register who is working on the project, with which role.

TO DO: part of instantiation would be to add meta data regarding curators etc in actors.md
TO DO: update this screenshot

![Top structure of the Template repository.](./media/template_structure.png){#fig:template}


<!--
The process, step by step
-------------------------

### Instantiation

The first step is to create an instance of the SWHAP-TEMPLATE[^5], that
should be named SWName-Workbench*,* and then to clone it to obtain a
local copy on your machine[^6].

From this point on, you'll be able to upload files and to
modify/copy/move them locally, and use *Git* commands to push changes to
GitHub.

Let us now see the steps to be followed, together with some
explanations.
-->

Collect
----------------

### Collect artifacts and upload them

In this first phase you want to spend times collecting the sofwtare artifacts, either in physical or digital format. Appart from source code, it is also important to collect relevant ancillary materials such as pictures, documentation, articles etc.
Whenever possible, we encourage you to reach out to the authors of the softwares and/or to the institution they belonged to. They might hold some precious documents such as pictures, mails etc. 

We encourage you to digitalise (by scanning or photographying) all the relevant physical objects, since this process only focuses on digital items. Whenever possible, the physical objects should be stored in a dedicated warehouse.

The collected source code should then be stored in the `raw_source_code` folder. 
The other collected materials should be stored in the `additional_materials` folder, in the corresponding subfolder. 


<!-- MF: should'nt that be done in the metadata folder? I feel like Spectrum guidelines are way over the top, we are not a museum. + is this our role? 
If there are physical materials, folder `raw_materials` should contain
a reference to the related Warehouse, that may follow the Spectrum
guidelines [\[8\]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?X25TEk).

MF: wrong link, to be updated if relevant
-->

### Make the source code machine readable

The next step is to ensure that the collected source code is made available in a machine-readable format. 
TO DO: I think we need to clarify why it is usefull to make it machine readable? Why not just keep the scan of paper listing? This should even be done earlier in the document, we need to explain what we put behind archiving a software, it is not self understanding. 

If the code is only available in non digital form (e.g. printed
listings), you can either transcribe it manually, or use a scanner and
an OCR (optical character recognition) tool to parse it. See
[[Appendix
A]{.underline}](http://www.corestandards.org/assets/Appendix_A.pdf)
for a list of suggested tools. 

If the raw source code is an archived and/or compressed file (.tar) and/or compressed, you should unpack it locally on your computer. 

Once you made your source code machine readable, all the source code files must then be put into the `browsable_source_code`
folder, using a dedicated subfolder for each version (typically `mySoftware_V1`, `mySoftware_V2` etc).

Particular care should be used to ensure the files in
`browsable_source_code` have the correct extension: scanner and OCR usually
generate files with a generic .txt extension, that must be changed to
the extension typically used for the programming language they
contain.

Note that, at this stage, we are not interested in precise information
about the versions of the software. The purpose is to have
machine-readable documents.


Curate 
----------------

### Fill in the catalogue

To each collected material (source code or other material) should correspond an entry in the catalogue. This catalogue will become the entry point of anyone willing to navigate your collection, and it is important that information is maintained clear and up to date. Depending on the type of object you are registering, you may want to record different information. We propose the following template, that can be adapted for each type of object:

- Object name: _Name of the material_
  - Authors: _Author of the code, picture, article etc_
  - Date: _Creation/publication date_
  - Digital location: _Link to the corresponding folder in your working environment_
  - Warehouse: _Link to the physical warehouse where the object is stored_
  - Collectors: _Name of the person who collected the object_
  - Description: _Description of the object, for source code, indicate the version_
  - Copyright: _Personn or institution holding the copyrights_
  - License: _Distribution license_
  - Notes: _Any additional information_

You may not be able to fill in all the information from the beginning, so you should keep this file updated as new information may come up. You can also add additional field if you think it helps better identify the item. 

MF: should there be one entry per software version? Then redundant with codemeta json and to some extent with version excel file. 
MF: I think the catalogue should be more structured, with clear and pre-identified subcategories.


### Go on license hunting

If you own the copyright of the source code or any other material then you can freely decide what you will be willing to share on any given plateform. 
At this point you might however have collected items for which you are not the copyright owner, or not the sole copyright owner. 

In that case you will want to check if you are allowed to collect and share these items, and if so under which conditions. 

Regarding source code, it might be the case that the software you are working on is under a free license such as _GNU General Public License_. Such license will typically let you freely archive and share the source code on any plateform you'd like, as well as any derived materials such as logos or screenshots. 

Regarding other material, such as working documents, photos, videos, it might be the case that there is no predefined license attached to them. In that case you may want to reach out to the copyright owner and ask them for their authorisation to archive and share their documents. You will want to be specific on the use you will make of these documents and about the plateforms you will use in the process. 

As you get more information about copyrights and licenses don't forget to fill in the `catalogue.md` file accordingly. You will also want to keep a record of all the authorisations you may have been granted : that might mean storing email discussions or contract pdf for the record.  

TO DO: be more specific about what to do with authorizations. No dedicated folder for now.
TO DO: show a template of license? DIfference between free license and specific license. 

If you can't get a sharing license for some items you own (ex: press article), you should still reference the items in `catalogue.md` along with storage location and contact point. Some people might see the catalgoe in the future and be interested in accessing it and get a contact point. However, you are not allowed to publicly publish these items. Thy should be stored in a dedicated folder that can stay in the private `Workbench` but can't be published in the public `Depository`. 

<!--
don't have copy rights (ex: press articles, photos etc.). Whenever possible we recommand to reach out to the copyright owners and ask if they would be willing to let you use and share their material. See below for more details on copyrights (Add a section about the different cases). If you obtain the copyright for a specific item, store the related contractual document (it can be a simple email) in the `copyrights` (MF: to be created) folder and update the copyright information in the `catalogue.md` file. 
-->
 

### Curate the source code

Modern progamming practice use versionning systems to allow to track changes made in the source code at a very detailed level. While that level of information may not be available for legacy softwares, the curation work will focus on rebuilding _part_ of the development history. This will allow a future viewer of the code to easily compare the different versions of the code and to easily see the differences and evolutions from one version to the other. 

To recreate the development history of the software we will leverage the *commit* and *versionning* mechanisms of Git. 
This system allows to stack versions of the software one upon the other, only storing the differences (also called _deltas_) between each versions. Each layer of the stack can be associated to metadata that we will leverage to make the distinction between the author of the software and the curator, and between the creation date and the curation date.  

We recommand to fill in the following metadata field for each commit:
- author name: name of the main author                                          
- author email: email of the main author, when available                         
- date original: original date when this version was made                         
- curator name: name of the curator person or team                               
- curator email: the reference email of the acquisition process                   
- release tag: a tag name if the directory contains a release, empty otherwise  
- message: text containing a brief note from the curation team              

TO DO : update with actual name of metadata field.

<!--
To prepare for the reconstruction itlsef you need to organize your source code files properly and to identify metadata.  -->

<!-- unclear sentence
Once the Depository creation is complete, you can move back to the
`source` folder in the master branch. -->


<!--
First, sort out the source code files present int the `browsable_source` folder, putting them in a different folder for each version. You can typically call each folder `MySoftware-V1.0`, `MySoftware-V2.0`etc. 

Second, fill in the information that will be used in the metadata of the commits.

In practice, this means that *for each version of the software* you
need to ascertain:

-   the *main contributing author*,
-   the *exact date* of the release of this particular version

This information should be consigned in the `version_history.csv` in the `metadata`folder, with the following fields:

\rowcolors{1}{gray!10}{white} 

| Field name          | description                                                      |
|---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| directory name 	 | name of the directory containing the source code of this version |
| author name    	 | name of the main author                                          |
| author email   	 | email of the main author, when available                         |
| date original  	 | original date when this version was made                         |
| curator name   	 | name of the curator person or team                               |
| curator email  	 | the reference email of the acquisition process                   |
| release tag   	  | a tag name if the directory contains a release, empty otherwise  |
| message 	 | text containing a brief note from the curation team              |

-->
Now you are ready to (re-)create the development history of the
software, by successively commiting the source code files of each version from the `browsable source code` into the `versionned source code` folder, updating the commits metadata to reflect historical develoment.  



<!--First you need to create a branch Source Code, with the
*source* folder.-->

You can proceed in two ways:

-   *manually*: using the *Git* commands to push the successive versions
    into the `versionned source code` folder, manually updating the metadata using the data collected during the curation phase in the catalogue.md file ;

-   *automatically*: if a great number of versions have been collected it might become very tedious to commit them manually one by one. To alleviate the hurdle, we set up a tool that can automatically do it for you. To allow the tool to work, you will first need to gather the commit metadata for all the versions in one csv file, that the tool will be able to read from. Then you will be able to reconstruct the development history of the software in one single run; using the [DT2SG Tool developed by University of Pisa](https://github.com/Unipisa/DT2SG). You can see a running example in the next section.

TO DO: make an actual test of the code, see if is working etc. Sould we store the code in a colab notebook to make it ready to run for a non expert user?

The result will be a `versionned source code` folder that materializes the development history
of the software via Git commits and releases.

### Create the final Source Code repository

Using this `versionned_source_code` folder, you can finally create the "official" software repository. This repository will be used for ingestion in the Software Heritage Archive, as described in the following step. 

TO DO: explain why a separate repo needs to be created

<!--
### Curate the ancillary materials

From the `raw_materials` folder, select the ancillary materials that you wish to keep for archival and presentation, and move them in the `additional_materials` foLder. You should sort them in the right subfolder : `software_moment`, `people_moment` or `other_materials`. (MF: are these the right subfolders? At this point of the process we are curating , not presenting yet. I think the folder organisation should have its own logic indepently of the choice of presentation)

To every collected item should correspond an entry in the `catalogue.md`file, located in the `metadata`folder. If there are physical materials, make a different entry for the object itself, indicating its warehouse or storage location, and for its digital version. (MF: is it the case? Shall we also register the source code in the catalogue file?)
-->

### Create final Depository repository

MF: we need to explain what this depository is actually for. Also why create a branch and not just create directly the Depository?
Shall we fill in the `additional amterials`folder before creating the Depository ? This seems more like the curating phase

Create the final `Depository` repository, containing only the
folders `raw_source_code`, `browsable_source_code`, `additional_materials` together with the
metadata updated to this point. 

Remember to remove the folder containing items for which you did not get the copyrights or sharing license. 
This will be the publicly available showcase of your work. 

TO DO: if the items with no public license are scattered in the additional materials folder, it might be quite tedious to remove them. Shall they be stored in dedicated subfolder?


Archive
----------------

### Archiving Source Code

Even though Software Heritage automatically archives any repository publicly available on Github we suggest yout to specifically schedule it to make sure everything runs smoothly. To do so, visit the Software Heritage ["Save code now" page](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/save/), and submit the URL of you `Source Code` final repository.  You can then follow the archival status of your code [there](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/save/list/).

Once your repository has been archived you can search for its archive location using its URL in Software Heritage. Clicking on the `Permaling tab` and clicking on the two `archived` badges, you can retrieve a markdown code snippet. Use these code snippets in the READ.ME of your `Source Code` repository. This will display the badges on the first page of your repository, allowing anyone visiting it to click on them and get access to its archive on Software Heritage.

MF: do we want to forammy archive the `Depository`repo? 


### Archiving additional materials and software information

As much as possible, the Archiving of additional materials will take place using the open source platforms.

**General software information** 
Regarding general software information as well as pictures and photos, we will use Wikimedia and Wikidata. 
Beware, only items with [free license](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing#Acceptable_licenses) are allowed to be archived on Wikimedia. Typically, if the software you are working on is distributed under a free-license (typically an open-source software), the logos or screenshots taken will also be considered as being under free license. 

To start, search Wikidata to see if an item for the software title exists. If no item is found, create a new item. An item is made up of different _statements_, which are different block of information linked to that article. Each statement describes a different _property_ of the item. A proprerty is identified with a code starting with letter `P, which we will refer to later on to let you easily search for a given property. 

Add statements to the Wikidata item based on the codemeta.json file as well as any other available information using properties related to software. You can use the Wikidata item about [Scilab](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q828742) as an example.

(TO DO: elaborate on list of information. Only place where JSON file is used? Then let's just use a simple csv, easier to ediit no?)

**Pictures and photos**
Regarding archiving images and pictures: if there is only one image to archive, you can directly link it to the Wikidata item using a new statement with property P18. 
If there are multiple images, you can create a category for the software title in Wikimedia Commons and the returns to Wikidata and uses field P373 to connect the category to the Wikidata item.

**Videos**

**Articles**
TO DO: add link to hall. 


Present
----------------

TO DO: Add story creation instructions


Iteration
---------

TO DO : to be updated, I don't think adding a simple picture should require clone and pushing etc. 

New material may be discovered after the process has been completed,
triggering an iteration of some of the phases described above. In this
case, we recommend to proceed as follows:

-   if new raw material (non-source code) is found, we have to clone the
    Depository repository and add new items to it. In this way, the
    performed commits will correctly follow the previous ones.

-   if new source code is found, after we collected it in the
    Depository, we have the following cases:

> \(1) The recovered source code is related to a version which is already
> included in the software history.
>
> \(2) The source code represents a completely new version, with respect to
> the software history as it was previously collected.

We are not finished yet, since in both cases the SourceCode repository
is no longer consistent with the collected source code, and we have to
recreate it, performing the following steps:

-   Delete the SourceCode repository.

-   Move back to the Workbench and according to the current case:

> if (1), add the source code to the correct version.
>
> if (2), add the new version folder with the related metadata.

-   Recreate the software history as for the first iteration.

A walkthrough on a running example {#sec:walkthrough}
==================================

In this section we will show the process at work on one of the first
source code acquired by the SWHAP\@Pisa project, the CMM conservative
garbage collector for C++ that was initially developed for project PoSSo
(Polynomial System Solver) and later became the basis for the Java GC
and the Oak GC [\[7\]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?tVCOZn).
Since it has evolved through various versions, CMM is a good workbench
for SWHAPPE and an appropriate example to show how to use the tools.

### Starting the process

The acquisition process of the CMM software started informally when one
of the authors, still active in the Computer Science department, learned
about the SWHAP project, and proposed to search for the source code and
make it available to the project. Shortly after, we received a mail
message with all the sources, as well as the associated research
article. Since the materials were already in digital form, the process
does not involve a Warehouse.

### Instantiation

![Instantiation of the template](./media/temp_inst.png){#fig:temp_inst}

We instantiate on GitHub the SWHAP repository template[^8] into a new
repository[^9], that we name "CMM-Workbench". This action, as most of
the following ones, can be performed through the user interface (as
shown in Figure {@fig:temp_inst}), or programmatically through the GitHub API.

It has the same directory structure as SWHAP-Template, as shown in Figure
{@fig:template}.

![Instantiated workbench for CMM.](./media/cmm_wb_inst.png){#fig:cmm_wb_inst}

To facilitate the search of the created repository, we add the 
"software-heritage", "workbench" and "swhappe" tags, as shown in Figure
{@fig:workbench_tags}.

![Tags for the workbench for CMM.](./media/workbench_tags.png){#fig:workbench_tags}

To start working, we create a local copy on our computer, cloning this
repository[^10]. By clicking on the green button "clone or download"
(Figure {@fig:cmm_wb_inst}), we get a link that we can use for this purpose in the
following command from the command line:

    git clone https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM-Workbench.git

Now, we have a local copy of the CMM-Workbench, and we can, first of
all, update the README.md file with the correct name and description of
the acquisition, and synchronize it with the remote repository:

	git add README.md
	git commit README.md -m "Updated README"
	git push

We are now ready to start the collect phase.

### Upload files in raw\_materials

Here we fill the local folders with the collected material. In the case
of CMM, we got a tar.gz file containing the various versions of the
software, organized according to an ad-hoc versioning system. In the
`raw_materials` folder we store also the paper presenting the software
and the email that Giuseppe Attardi sent us along with them,
and we commit all these new contents:

	git add raw_materials
	git commit -m "Added raw material"
	git push

The resulting state of `raw_materials` is shown in Figure {@fig:cmm_raw}.

![CMM raw materials on GitHub.](./media/cmm_raw.png){#fig:cmm_raw}

### Unpack the source code in the browsable\_source directory 

In order to get a browsable version of the source code, we decompress
the .tar.gz archive into the `browsable_source` folder

    tar -xzf raw_materials/cmm.tgz -C browsable_source

and commit the changes as done for the `raw_materials` folder

    git add browsable_source
    git commit -m "Added browsable source"
    git push

We can see the resulting state of the repository in Figure {@fig:cmm_brows}.

![CMM browsable sources on GitHub.](./media/cmm_brows.png){#fig:cmm_brows}

Finally, in preparation for the next phase, curation, we copy the files
contained in `browsable_source` into the `source` folder[^11].

    cp -r browsable_source source

Again, we stage changes as in the previous two steps.

	git add source
	git commit -m "Added source"
	git push

### Create Depository

The Depository has been filled, hence we create the Depository as an
orphan branch, i.e., with no references to the parent repository, using
the checkout command:

    git checkout --orphan Depository

As a result, we moved to the Depository branch. Here we modify the
README (guidelines to fill the README file are given in the template)
and remove the `source` and `metadata` folder, since they are not
interesting for this area:

    git rm -rf source metadata

We stage the last modifications and then push to the remote repository.

	git add .
	git commit -m "Added raw materials from master branch"
	git push --mirror origin

We are almost ready to move the Depository to a new repository: before that,
however, we have to create the new remote repository on GitHub (Figure
{@fig:cmm_depo_creat} shows how to do this using the web interface; here too one
could use the GitHub API instead).

![CMM-Depository creation.](./media/cmm_depo_creat.png){#fig:cmm_depo_creat}

To facilitate the search of the created repository, we add the 
"software-heritage", "depository" and "swhappe" tags (in the same way of 
what done for the workbench as shown in Figure
{@fig:workbench_tags}).


### Final depository

Finally, we can perform a push and fill the remote repository.

    git push https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM-Depository.git +Depository:master

We can check the resulting repositories via the web interface (Figure
{@fig:cmm_repos}): CMM-Depository is now filled with the pushed materials.

![The CMM repositories at the end of the collect phase.](./media/cmm_repos.png){#fig:cmm_repos}

The Depository branch is then removed from the Workbench, to avoid
having multiple copies that may diverge. Should new materials became
available, a new iteration of the process should start, re-initializing
the Workbench with the information in the Depository.

	git checkout master
	git push --delete origin Depository
	git branch -D Depository

### Curate the code

#### Version History

In this phase, the curation team should clean up the code and organize
it in separate folders, one per version. In the case of CMM, the code is
already structured this way, as shown in Figure
{@fig:cmm_repos}, so there is nothing
to do.

In order to support the (re-)creation of the development history of the
original project, we prepare the `version_history.csv` file with the
appropriate metadata (see Figure {@fig:cmm_vers_hist}).

![The version history for CMM](./media/cmm_vers_hist.png){#fig:cmm_vers_hist}


#### Codemeta

Contextually we fill the `metadata/codemeta.json` template file (see Figure {@fig:cmm_json}, left) with metadata according to [CodeMeta guidelines](https://codemeta.github.io/terms/) obtaining what shown in  (see Figure {@fig:cmm_json}, right).

![CMM instantiation (right) of codemeta.json template (left)](./media/cmm-codemeta.png){#fig:cmm_json}


#### License

To conclude the curation phase, we have to identify licensing information.

If we find a file specyfing the licence in the source code, we have to copy its content in the `metadata/LICENCE` file.  Otherwise, in the case there is no licensing file in the source and we obtained license information in other finds, we fill `metadata/LICENCE` according to the [SPDX standard](https://spdx.org/licenses/).


### (Re-)Create the development History

The development history can now be (re-)created either by issuing manually (i.e. for each version directory) the appropriate git commands, or by using a specialised tool.

##### Manually

We have to create a clean dedicated SourceCode branch

	git checkout --orphan SourceCode
	git rm -rf *

Then, for every directory containing a version of the source code, in
chronological order, we copy its contents from the `master` branch to the
current branch, and commit it with the appropriate metadata.

For example, for the directory 1.9 of the CMM sources, here is how
we copy the source contents into our branch:

	git checkout master -- source/1.9
	mv source/1.9/* .
	rm -rf source

Then we use the following template to create manually an individual commit/release:

	export GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
	export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Commiter Name"
	export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="email@address"
	export GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
	export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Author Name"
	export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=<email@address>"
	git add -A
	git commit -m "Commit Message Here"
	
We also need to add an annotated tag to this version. For version 1.9 of CMM, here is
the command we used, you can adapt it to your needs:

	git tag -a 1.9 -m "Version 1.9"

Finally, we clean up the directory before importing a new version

    git rm -rf *

##### With DT2SG

And here is an example using the [[DT2SG]{.underline}](#t3q5s097euy)
tool

    dotnet ./DT2SG/DT2SG_app.dll
      -r SWHAP-EXAMPLE/CMM-Workbench
      /source/cmm/
      -m SWHAP-EXAMPLE/CMM-Workbench
      metadata/version_history.csv

As a result we will find in our local repository a new local branch
containing the rebuilt version history, that is shown in Figure {@fig:cmm_sh}.

![An excerpt of the synthetic history of CMM.](./media/cmm_sh.png){#fig:cmm_sh}

### Create the final repository

We move back to the master branch using the checkout command, then
remove `raw_materials`, `browsable_source` and `source` from it:

	git rm -rf raw_materials browsable_source source

We now create the README.md file, add it and commit changes:

	git add README.md
	git commit -m "Final repository created"

Now we create the final remote repository, that we call "CMM", see
Figure {@fig:create_fin}, and we push the relevant branches (and tags) to it.

![The creation of the final repository.](./media/create_fin.png){#fig:create_fin}

    git push --tags git@github.com:Unipisa/CMM.git +master:master +SourceCode:SourceCode

To facilitate the search of the created repository, we add the 
"software-heritage", "archive" and "swhappe" tags (in the same way of 
what done for the workbench as shown in Figure
{@fig:workbench_tags}).

Figures {@fig:cmm_final}, {@fig:cmm_depo}, {@fig:cmm_wb} show the final result of CMM, their Depository and
Workbench.

![The final CMM repository.](./media/cmm_final.png){#fig:cmm_final}

![The final CMM Depository.](./media/cmm_depo.png){#fig:cmm_depo}

![The final CMM Workbench.](./media/cmm_wb.png){#fig:cmm_wb}

### Publish the repositories and trigger Software Heritage acquisition

In order to publish the Depository and SourceCode repositories we have to set
their visibility to "public", either through GitHub web interface or using the
GitHub API as follows:

    curl -s -H 'Authorization: token '$auth_token'' 
     -H "application/vnd.github.baptiste-preview+json" 
     --data '{"private": false}'
     -X PATCH https://api.github.com/repos/$org/$repository_archive

where **\$repository\_archive** is CMM or CMM-Depository and **\$auth\_token**
is the authorizzarion token. As a result, the code is now publicly visible at

[**[https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM/]{.underline}**](https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM/)

Finally, we trigger the archival of this repository in Software
Heritage, using the "save code now" functionality. This can be done
using the web interface at
**[[https://save.softwareheritage.org]{.underline}](https://save.softwareheritage.org)**,
or by connecting to the API on the command line as follows:

    curl -s -X POST https://archive.softwareheritage.org/api/1/origin/save/git/url/$repo_url

where  **\$repo_url** is `https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM/`.

A short time after (this may go up to a few hours for huge repositories), the archived software will be visible in the Software Heritage archive
at 

[**[https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM]{.underline}**](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM)

### Fill the Workbench metadata

In order to preserve information about the curation process we have to fill the template files under the Workbench `metadata`.
Starting from some template files (see Figure {@fig:cmm-metadata}, left), we obtain what shown in Figure {@fig:cmm-metadata}, right.


![The CMM Metadata.](./media/cmm-metadata.png){#fig:cmm-metadata}


In particular we should create :

+ a catalogue : `metatdata/catalogue.md`, where each item in the `raw_materials` should have a record describing its origin, the possible warehouse, their authors and collectors along with a description. The result of `tree -a` on `raw_materials` should be included;
+ a journal :`metatdata/journal.md`, where each collect and curate action should be annotated;
+ an actors registry: `metatdata/actors.md`, every person taking part in the process should be registered, with their roles, affiliations and contact information;
+ a notepad : `metatdata/journal.md` where write possible information not covered by previous files.

Appendix A - General Motivation for using Git and GitHub
================================

The choice of Git as the designated tool for traceability and historical
accuracy, and of GitHub as the unifying platform to support the SWHAP
process proceeds from several considerations that we review below.

First of all we discuss the choice of *Git*. One of the key requirements
set forth for SWHAP is the need to ensure *full traceability* of the
operations performed on the recovered digital assets. This means that
each of the virtual places must provide means to record the history of
the modifications made to the digital assets, with information on *who
did what and when*. It is very convenient to use the same tool in all of
the virtual places of the process, as this reduces the learning effort
and streamlines the process. All modern version control systems provide
the needed functionality, and we have chosen *Git* as our standard tool,
as it is open source (another of our requirements) and broadly adopted.
*Git* is a powerful tool, and requires some expertise to make the most
out of it. However, a large part of the process is scriptable, and this
will hide the underlying complexity to the final user, which can then
focus on the main issue: curating and preserving the code and its
history.

Another important motivation for our choice of Git is the ability to
support *historical accuracy*, i.e., providing a faithful view of the
history of both the recovered source code and the acquisition process,
as prescribed by the SWHAP key requirements. This is properly
accommodated by the commit and versioning mechanisms offered by Git,
that allow to separate authors from committers: this way on can record
both the story of the original software and the story of its curation.

Finally, we had to choose one of the many online platforms that allow to
collaborate using *Git*. GitHub, GitLab.com and Bitbucket are the most
known ones and are all regularly archived in Software Heritage, so that
*long term availability* of their contents is preserved, no matter which
one of these platforms is chosen.

Among all these platforms, GitHub is by far the most popular and active,
and is also the platform adopted by the University of Pisa, so it was a
natural choice, and we believe this will make the learning curve gentler
for most SWHAP adopters.

In the following, we provide detailed guidelines to instantiate the
process using Git on GitHub. We think that most of what is described in
the guide can be easily adapted to any of the other *Git*-based
collaborative platforms.

<a name="appendixb"/>

Appendix B - Tools that can help
================================

Here is a list of tools for code acquisition and curation that have been
used during the initial experimentation of SWHAPPE:

-   Used/suggested OCR:

    -   Tesseract
        ([[https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/]{.underline}](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/)).
        It can be installed and used from command line. An API is also
        provided to use the OCR in a script.

    -   OCR.space
        ([[https://ocr.space/]{.underline}](https://ocr.space/)).
        Online OCR and free API.

-   Dedicated scripts:

    -   DT2SG-Directory Tree 2 Synthetic Git
        ([[https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAP-DT2SG]{.underline}](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAP-DT2SG)).
        Creates the synthetic history of the software.

    -   SWHAP-EXAMPLE([[https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAP-EXAMPLE]{.underline}](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAP-EXAMPLE))

Many other tools exist, and are currently under construction and will be
loaded on the SWHAPPE repository on GitHub.

<a name="appendixc"/>

Appendix C - A few tips on Github
=================================

*Git* is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in
source code during software development. Here, we provide some
references on *Git* and the GitHub platform.

For a review on GitHub key concepts, you can see the following glossary:

[[https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-glossary]{.underline}](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-glossary).

In order to fully exploit Github, you should install *Git* on your pc:

[[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git]{.underline}](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

This will allow you to use Git from command line. Even if it can be less
intuitive, it's more powerful than working with the web interface: for
instance, you can upload folders and files of any size, without the
limitations of the latter. Furthermore, using Git commands allows for
instantiating the process on any Git supported platform. For a review of
the commands, please check the manual: [[
https://git-scm.com/docs]{.underline}](https://git-scm.com/docs).

As an alternative, if you're using a Mac or Windows, you can download
Github Desktop, which provides a comfortable GUI: [[
https://desktop.github.com/]{.underline}](https://desktop.github.com/).

For more information about the commit mechanism and how to see the log
of changes, please see the following link:
[[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History]{.underline}](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History).
	
To implement the process and separate areas, we chose to create two
different branches (Depository and SourceCode) and get the corresponding
repositories from them. Each branch has an independent commit history,
thus the history of Depository and SourceCode is kept clean and easy to
consult. Here is a discussion on how to see the branch history:
